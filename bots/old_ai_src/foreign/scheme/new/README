* New XPAI notes

  This API is different from the previous in a few, overrarching ways.
  I've tried to be as consistent as possible where it makes sense. Here
  are some generalizations of the changes.

  - Question marks are only used for functions that return #t or #f, following the
    scheme convention
  - I've removed the prefixes, i.e. AIself.thrust -> thrust, AIship.track? -> track.
    x/y have been renamed to x-pos and y-pos, respectively
  - Wherever possible I allow for multiple arguments and return multiple values. Some
    examples:
    New					 Old
    (x-pos)				  -> (AIself.x)
    (x-pos index)			  -> (AIship.x index)
    (x-pos idx1 idx2)		          -> (values (AIship.x idx1) (AIship.x idx2))
    (talk "A split-up" "message")	  -> (AI.talk "A split-up message")
    (xpilot "-join localhost" "-name Foo")-> (xpilot_launch "-join localhost -name Foo")
    (angleadd 30 40 120 80)		  -> (angleadd 30 (angleadd 40 (angleadd 120 80)))

    I did this for two reasons: It effectively cuts the number of functions in half,
    and it caters to a functional style that makes code concise.

  - The wallbetween functions have been compressed into one function and extended, returning
    multiple values and dispatching on their arguments

    (wall-between 500 40)	  -> (wallbetween (AIself.x) (AIself.y) 300 40), <wall-x>, <wall-y>
    (wall-between 10 20 90 80)    -> (wallbetween 10 20 90 80), <wall-x>, <wall-y>

  - True and false values have been adapted to scheme. So, where a function usually returns
    a null string or -1, it returns #f. Functions that return 0 or 1 return #t or #f
  - Functions that perform an action, i.e. thrust, shoot take #t, #f, or no arguments, in
    which case it defaults to #t
  - The map-related functions have been reduced to two; tile and tile-set!. All translation
    from pixel coordinates to map coordinates is handled internally.
  - Functions do the rounding for you.
